ChatGPT said:
Great follow-up, Dhruv! To extract answers in a storytelling format—that relate you to real-world scenarios and make them easy to understand and remember—you need to tweak your prompt to tell the model:

Use narrative tone

Include a real-world setting

Position you as the protagonist

Focus on decision-making, consequences, and insights

✅ Generic Prompt for Storytelling-Style Answers
🎯 Instruction:
Using the concept: [Insert Concept]

📍 Real-World Scenario: [Insert practical situation]

🎭 Role: [Insert role, e.g., Founder, Engineering Manager, CTO]

📝 Output Requirements:
- Frame the answer as a real-life story.
- Make me (the reader or learner) the main character facing the problem.
- Show step-by-step how I handled it, what decisions I made, what mistakes (if any) happened, and what lessons I learned.
- Keep it engaging, human, and easy to understand for a professional in the tech/startup space.
🧪 Example Use
Prompt:
Concept: Product-Market Fit  
Real-World Scenario: You built an MVP but users aren’t returning after using it once.  
Role: Founder  
Frame the answer as a story where I’m the founder. I want to understand the situation emotionally and logically.
🧠 Sample Output (Storytelling Answer):
I had just launched my first MVP—a time-tracking app for freelancers. After 3 weeks, I noticed we had nearly 150 signups, but retention was terrible. Less than 10% came back after the first day.

At first, I blamed the UX. Maybe it was too clunky? I spent 2 weeks redesigning the onboarding flow. But guess what? It didn’t help.

That’s when I realized I was solving the wrong problem.

I reached out to 12 users. I asked open-ended questions like, “What were you expecting from the tool?” and “What do you use instead now?”

Turns out, freelancers weren’t looking for a tracker—they wanted proof of work with billing integration.

That’s the moment I understood: I had built a feature, not a solution.

So I pivoted. I added automatic invoice generation and Upwork integration. 3 months later, retention hit 45%, and I had 200 paid users.

Lesson? Product-market fit isn’t about fancy features—it’s about listening to pain points and making people’s lives easier.

🎯 Use this to Learn or Teach
🔄 For interviews: Retell your own experience based on this structure.

📖 For training juniors: Use these storytelling outputs in onboarding or mentoring decks.

📹 For content creation: Great base for podcasts, YouTube scripts, blog posts, or LinkedIn storytelling.

🔁 Variants of the Prompt
🎤 For Personalization:
Make the story feel like it’s *me* experiencing this. Include emotions, uncertainty, decisions, and learning moments.
🎞️ For Visual Thinking:
Describe the scenario visually like a short film, where I face the problem and solve it step-by-step with learnings.
👨‍🏫 For Teaching Others:
Explain the concept through a story that I can use to teach junior team members. Use analogies and real startup context.
Would you like a ready-made prompt card for Notion or a script that turns any topic + scenario into a story like this?
