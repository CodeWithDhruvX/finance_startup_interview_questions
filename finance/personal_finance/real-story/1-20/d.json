    "content": "### Story\nRahul, a 32-year-old IT professional from Pune, had ₹1.2 lakh outstanding on his credit card. The interest was 36% per annum, and only making minimum payments barely dented the principal. One day, after checking his credit score, he got an offer from his bank for a personal loan at 10.5% interest with a 2-year tenure.\n\nInitially skeptical, Rahul compared the costs. The credit card would cost him over ₹43,000 in interest over 2 years, while the personal loan would only cost around ₹13,000 in interest. He took the personal loan, cleared his credit card dues, and started paying off the loan in fixed EMIs.\n\nRahul also cut his credit card usage, set spending limits, and committed to never carrying forward dues again. Within 18 months, he was debt-free and had saved over ₹30,000 in interest. The experience taught him the difference between bad and manageable debt—and the importance of acting fast before high-interest debt spirals out of control."
