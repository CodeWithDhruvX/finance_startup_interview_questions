🎬 [Intro Slide: How Rahul Beat Credit Card Debt Trap]

🗣️ Host Speaking:

"Hey everyone! Let me ask you something…

You’re offered a personal loan with a 10.5% interest rate, but you also have a credit card with 36% interest outstanding. Should you take the personal loan to pay off the credit card dues? Why or why not? And what if you don’t?

Sounds like a real-life money puzzle, right?

Well, let’s explore this through a general purpose story — not real, but based on common situations many Indians face.

Meet Rahul. He’s a 32-year-old IT professional from Pune. Life was going fine until he found himself with a ₹1.2 lakh outstanding balance on his credit card.

Now here’s the scary part — the credit card charged 36% interest per annum! And like many of us, Rahul was only making the minimum payment every month. The problem? That barely touched the actual loan amount. Most of it was going towards interest.

One day, he decided to check his credit score online. To his surprise, his bank offered him a personal loan at just 10.5% interest, with a 2-year repayment tenure.

He was skeptical at first. Personal loan? Isn’t that more debt?

But then he did something smart — he compared the numbers.

📉 Staying with the credit card would’ve cost him over ₹43,000 in interest over 2 years.
💰 The personal loan? Only around ₹13,000 in interest.

So Rahul took the loan. He paid off his entire credit card balance in one shot. From that point on, he had fixed EMIs, no more surprises, and a clear plan.

He didn’t stop there. Rahul cut down his credit card usage, set spending limits, and promised himself never to carry forward dues again.

And guess what?

In just 18 months, Rahul was completely debt-free.
He also saved ₹30,000 in interest along the way!

That experience changed his money mindset. He now understood the difference between bad debt and manageable debt, and how taking action early can stop your finances from spiraling out of control.

💡 It’s a story, yes — but it’s also a reminder.

📌 If you’re stuck in high-interest debt, you do have options. But you need to act.

🎬 [Slide 2: Key Takeaway – Lessons Learned]

🗣️ Host Speaking:

"So what can we learn from Rahul’s story?

Let’s break it down into two simple but powerful lessons:

1️⃣ A lower-interest personal loan can be a smart way to escape high-interest credit card debt.

Credit card interest rates in India can go as high as 36% to 42% per annum, and if you're only making minimum payments, you're just feeding the interest monster.

On the other hand, personal loans — if you have a decent credit score — can be available at 10% to 15% interest. That’s less than half!

So you're basically trading an expensive loan for a cheaper, more manageable one. It's like switching from a leaky bucket to a proper water tank.

2️⃣ The sooner you act, the more money you save in interest.

Time is critical here. The longer you delay, the more interest piles up — and you fall deeper into the trap.

By taking action early, like Rahul did, you not only save thousands of rupees in interest, but also take back control of your money.

Think of it this way — it's not just about saving money, it's about saving peace of mind.

💬 So if you’re ever in a similar situation — compare, calculate, and act fast. Waiting too long can turn a small fire into a financial wildfire.

Alright! That wraps up the key lessons.

🎬 [Slide 3: Action Plan – Steps You Can Take]

🗣️ Host Speaking:

"Okay, now that we’ve seen Rahul’s journey and the lessons it teaches, let’s talk about what you can actually do if you’re in a similar situation.

Here’s your 5-step Action Plan to break free from the credit card debt trap:

✅ Step 1: Know Your Numbers

First, log in to your credit card account and check:

How much do you owe?

What’s the annual interest rate?

This is your starting point. Awareness is key.

✅ Step 2: Look for Better Loan Options

Visit your bank’s app or check trusted loan marketplaces like PaisaBazaar or BankBazaar.
Look for personal loans with interest rates of 15% or lower. If your credit score is good, you might get even better deals.

✅ Step 3: Use a Loan Calculator

Don’t guess — calculate!

Use any free online loan calculator to:

Compare how much interest you’d pay on your credit card over time vs.

What you’d pay on a personal loan.

If the difference is big, it’s worth switching.

✅ Step 4: Take the Loan — but Only for One Purpose

Once you're convinced, take the loan. But use 100% of it to pay off your credit card dues completely.
Don’t use it for shopping, investing, or other expenses. That defeats the whole purpose.

✅ Step 5: Build Better Habits

After paying off the credit card:

Avoid fresh spending on it.

Set monthly spending limits.

And most importantly, automate your EMI payments using auto-debit.

Stick to the plan, and you’ll be debt-free sooner than you think.

💡 Remember: This is not about avoiding credit, it’s about using credit smartly.

You don’t need to be a finance expert — just a little planning and discipline can go a long way.

That’s your roadmap to taking control. Let’s wrap this up!"
